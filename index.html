    <h1>Six Sigma</h1>
    <p>Six Sigma (6Ïƒ) is a set of techniques and tools for process improvement. It was introduced by American engineer Bill Smith while working at Motorola in 1986.[1][2]
    Six Sigma strategies seek to improve manufacturing quality by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. This is done by using empirical and statistical quality management methods and by hiring people who serve as Six Sigma experts. Each Six Sigma project follows a defined methodology and has specific value targets, such as reducing pollution or increasing customer satisfaction.
    The term Six Sigma originates from statistical quality control, a reference to the fraction of a normal curve that lies within six standard deviations of the mean, used to represent a defect rate.</p>
    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    <h2>DMAIC Process</h2>
    <p>DMAIC is a five-step process for improving business processes. The acronym stands for:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Define the problem</li>
    <li>Measure the Current State</li>
    <li>Analyze the Data</li>
    <li>Improve the Process</li>
    <li>Control the Process</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The DMAIC process can be used to improve any type of business process, from manufacturing to customer service. It is a systematic approach to problem solving that can help organizations achieve significant improvements in quality, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.</p>
    <h2><a href="DMAIC/define.html">Define the Problem</a></h2>
    <p>The first step in the DMAIC process is to define the problem. This involves understanding the root cause of the problem and identifying the specific areas that need to be improved.</p>
    <h2>Measure the Current State</h2>
    <p>The second step is to measure the current state of the process. This involves collecting data on the process and identifying the key performance indicators (KPIs) that need to be improved.</p>
    <h2>Analyze the Data</h2>
    <p>The third step is to analyze the data. This involves using statistical tools to identify the root causes of the problem and to develop hypotheses about how to improve the process.</p>
    <h2>Improve the Process</h2>
    <p>The fourth step is to improve the process. This involves implementing the changes that have been identified and evaluating the results.</p>
    <h2>Control the Process</h2>
    <p>The fifth and final step is to control the process. This involves ensuring that the improvements are sustained and that the process does not revert back to its original state.</p>
    <p>The DMAIC process is a powerful tool for improving business processes. By following the steps outlined above, organizations can achieve significant improvements in quality, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.</p>
