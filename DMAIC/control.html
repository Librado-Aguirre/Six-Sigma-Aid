<h1>Control Phase of Six Sigma</h1>
<p>The Control phase is the fifth and final step in the DMAIC process. The goal of the Control phase is to ensure that the improvements made in the Improve phase are sustained over time.</p>
<p>The Control phase typically includes the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish control limits.</li>
<li>Monitor the process.</li>
<li>Take corrective action.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Control phase is critical to the success of the Six Sigma project. If the improvements are not sustained, the project is unlikely to be successful.</p>
<h2>Establish Control Limits</h2>
<p>The first step in the Control phase is to establish control limits. Control limits are the boundaries within which the process should operate in order to maintain the improvements.</p>
<p>The control limits are established by using statistical methods such as control charts.</p>
<h2>Monitor the Process</h2>
<p>The next step in the Control phase is to monitor the process. This can be done by using control charts or other statistical methods.</p>
<p>The monitoring of the process will help to identify any deviations from the control limits.</p>
<h2>Take Corrective Action</h2>
<p>The final step in the Control phase is to take corrective action. If any deviations from the control limits are identified, corrective action should be taken to bring the process back within the control limits.</p>
<p>The corrective action should be taken in a timely manner in order to prevent the problems from escalating.</p>
<p>The Control phase is an important step in the Six Sigma process. By following the steps outlined above, you can ensure that the improvements made in the Improve phase are sustained over time.</p>
