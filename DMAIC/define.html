    <h1>Define Phase of Six Sigma</h1>
    <p>The Define phase of Six Sigma is the first step in the DMAIC process. The goal of the Define phase is to understand the problem that needs to be solved and to define the scope of the project.</p>
    <p>The Define phase typically includes the following steps:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Identify the customer and their needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Define</strong> the problem statement.</li>
    <li>Establish the project goals.</li>
    <li>Gather data on the current process.</li>
    <li>Create a charter for the project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Define phase is critical to the success of the Six Sigma project. If the problem is not properly defined, the project is likely to fail.</p>
    <h2>Identify the Customer and Their Needs</h2>
    <p>The first step in the Define phase is to identify the customer and their needs. This includes understanding the customer's requirements, expectations, and pain points.</p>
    <p>The customer can be internal or external. For example, if the project is to improve the manufacturing process, the customer could be the internal customer who uses the product or the external customer who buys the product.</p>
    <h2>Define the Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The next step is to define the problem statement. The problem statement should be clear, concise, and measurable. It should also identify the root cause of the problem.</p>
    <p>The problem statement should answer the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>What is the problem?</li>
    <li>Who is affected by the problem?</li>
    <li>Why is the problem important?</li>
    <li>What is the current state of the process?</li>
    <li>What is the desired state of the process?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Establish the Project Goals</h2>
    <p>The next step is to establish the project goals. The goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.</p>
    <p>The goals should also be aligned with the overall business goals. For example, if the overall business goal is to increase customer satisfaction, the goal of the Six Sigma project could be to reduce the number of defects by 50%.</p>
    <h2>Gather Data on the Current Process</h2>
    <p>The next step is to gather data on the current process. This data can be used to understand the root cause of the problem and to develop solutions.</p>
    <p>The data can be gathered through a variety of methods, such as surveys, interviews, and observations.</p>
    <h2>Create a Charter for the Project</h2>
    <p>The final step in the Define phase is to create a charter for the project. The charter should document the goals, scope, and resources for the project.</p>
    <p>The charter should also identify the team members and their roles.</p>
    <p>The Define phase is an important step in the Six Sigma process. By following the steps outlined above, you can ensure that the problem is properly defined and that the project is set up for success.</p>
